## BMI calculator

Create a BMI calculator app that allows users to enter their weight and height and whether they are entering these values in English or metric units, then calculates and displays the userâ€™s body mass index.

The app should also display the following information from the Department of Health and Human Services/National Institutes of Health so that users can evaluate their BMIs:

BMI VALUES -->
Underweight:	less than 18.5 | 
Normal:	between 18.5 and 24.9 | 
Overweight:	between 25 and 29.9 | 
Obese:	30 or greater
