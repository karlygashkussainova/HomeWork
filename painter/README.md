## Advanced Painter

Incorporate the RGBA color chooser you created in the Color Chooser app (Section 13.4 ) into the Painter app (Section 13.3 ) so that the user can choose any drawing color. Changing a Sliderâ€™s value should update the color swatch displayed to the user and set the brushColor instance variable to the current Color
